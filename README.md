# CIVE 202 Spring 2025 Portfolio – husker123

Welcome to my CIVE 202 project portfolio! This repository showcases the work I completed during the Spring 2025 semester in *CIVE 202: Intro to Civil Engineering Computing* at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln. These projects demonstrate my proficiency in Python programming, data analysis, engineering calculations, and professional technical reporting.

## 📁 Project List

### 🔍 Project 1 – Water Quality Python Analysis
- **Summary**: Used Nebraska public water system (PWS) contaminant data to identify pollution trends by type and location.
- **Skills**: Data cleaning with Pandas, `.groupby()` analysis, summary statistics, data visualization.

### 🏗️ Project 2 – Bridge Inspection Data Dashboard
- **Summary**: Processed and visualized bridge inspection scores for Nebraska using public infrastructure datasets.
- **Skills**: CSV filtering, conditional formatting, bar/line plots in Matplotlib, file input/output.

### 🌱 Project 3 – Agricultural Nitrate & pH Assessment
- **Summary**: Evaluated spatial distribution of nitrate and pH levels across Nebraska using ArcGIS-ready tables and statistical summaries.
- **Skills**: Exploratory data analysis, chemical concentration trends, environmental correlation, map preparation support.

### 🌪️ Project 4 – Redefining FEMA Risk Index
- **Summary**: Developed a custom hazard risk metric focused on drought and cold wave events for Nebraska and New York, integrating FEMA’s National Risk Index (NRI) and CDC’s Social Vulnerability Index (SVI).
- **Skills**: Multi-dataset merging, metadata interpretation, custom metric design, code ethics reflection, stakeholder communication.

### 🧱 Project 5 – Concrete Mix Design Automation
- **Summary**: Built a Python tool to automate concrete mix design calculations for multiple use scenarios (eco-friendly, workable, standard).
- **Skills**: Engineering formula implementation, absolute volume method, user-defined functions, Excel and PDF integration, visual chart generation.
